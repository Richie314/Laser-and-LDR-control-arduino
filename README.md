# Laser-and-LDR-control-arduino
Code used to run Arduino to read a photoresitor (LDR) hit by a laser, also controlled by Arduino. Data is provided through the Serial
The Arduino supports different commands, that can be altered and modified by changing which (.h) file to include under "Languages/"
The code returns the voltage read on the pin, and with that it is possible to arrive at the resistor value
